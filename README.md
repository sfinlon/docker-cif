# How to run CIFv3 Docker Container?
```
C=$(docker run --name cifv3 -it -d \
-p 443:443 \
-p 5000:5000 \
ventz/docker-cif)
```

# Get an interactive shell onto the container:
```
docker exec -it $C /bin/bash
```

# Test Setup
Once you have a shell, become the cif user:
```
# su cif
```

and do a sanity check to verify that everything works:
```
$ cif -p
```

You can do this as "root" too, but it's not recommended.

For a full suite of tests, you can also run:
```
/root/test.sh
```
